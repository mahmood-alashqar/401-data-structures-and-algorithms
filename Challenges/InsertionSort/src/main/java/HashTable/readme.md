# HashTable
class implements a hash table, which maps keys to values. Any non-null object can be used as a key or as a value. To successfully store and retrieve objects from a hashtable, the objects used as keys must implement the hashCode method and the equals method.

- create HashNode class contains key, value and hashcode.
- create HashTable class contains HashTable constucter ,getBucketIndex,add(K key, V value),remove(K key) and get(K key).
